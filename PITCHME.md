# Vue.js

Exploring a frontend framework

---

### What is Vue

- It's the view layer, ie easy data reactivity
- It's like React (declarative rending.  Change data=> Dom changes.)
- "Progressive user interface framework"
    - (lots of different libraries to glue together, "batteries optional")

---

### Why do I care?

Vue has:

- frontend power with lower complexity
- a very shallow learning curve
- comparable performance to major frameworks, ex React
- a tiny memory footprint (~30KB)
- Weex (like React Native) and backing by Chinese tech giants

If you like prototyping like I do, Vue has low up-front costs.
